For a game to be allowed, the game must be an official release. Fan games do not count. Games that only released overseas are allowed.

For a character to count as being present in a game, the following must be true:
1) The character has to be present. References like costumes, music, or catchphrases do NOT count.
2) The character has to be interactable. Static characters in a background image do NOT count.
3) The character has to 'exist' in the game world. For example, even though Virtua Fighter is present as a mini-game in Yakuza: Like a Dragon, the characters don't actually exist within the game, so this would not count.
4) The character has to be a released part of the game. DLC counts. Official mods do not.
5) The character has to be an actual character. Generic enemies, like 'dragon' or 'slime', are not allowed. 'Specific' enemies, like Tiamat, are allowed.
